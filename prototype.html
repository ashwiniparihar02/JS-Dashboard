    <h1>Prototypal Inheritance</h1>
    <p>In JavaScript, prototypal inheritance is a key concept that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. Unlike classical inheritance found in some other programming languages, JavaScript uses a prototype chain to achieve inheritance.</p><br>
    <p>Objects and Prototypes:<br>

        Every object in JavaScript has a prototype, which is another object from which it inherits properties.
        The prototype is accessed through the __proto__ property or, in modern JavaScript, using the Object.getPrototypeOf() method.
        Constructor Functions:
        
        Constructor functions are used to create objects with a shared prototype.
        When a new object is created using a constructor function with the new keyword, the prototype of the new object is set to the prototype property of the constructor function.<br>
