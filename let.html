        Compared with var, let declarations have the following differences:
         <ul>
         <li>let declarations are scoped to blocks as well as functions.</li>
         <li>let declarations can only be accessed after the place of declaration is reached (see temporal dead zone). For this reason, let declarations are commonly regarded as non-hoisted.</li>
         <li>let declarations do not create properties on globalThis when declared at the top level of a script.</li>
         <li>let declarations cannot be redeclared by any other declaration in the same scope.</li>
         <li>let begins declarations, not statements. That means you cannot use a lone let declaration as the body of a block (which makes sense, since there's no way to access the variable).
