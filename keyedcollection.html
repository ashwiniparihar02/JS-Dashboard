    <h1> KEYED COLLECTION</h1>
    <p>In JavaScript, a "keyed collection" typically refers to data structures that allow you to store and retrieve values using keys. There are several built-in keyed collections in JavaScript, and two of the most commonly used ones are:</p><br>
    <p>Map:<br>
        Key Types:<br>
        
        Map allows any data type, including objects and primitives, as keys.
        Memory Management:<br>
        
        Memory management is not tied to the map entries. Even if the keys are objects, the map entries won't prevent those objects from being garbage collected.
        Iteration:<br>
        
        Iterating over a Map is straightforward, and you can easily loop through key-value pairs using methods like forEach.<br>

            WeakMap:<br>
Key Types:<br>

WeakMap only allows objects as keys. Primitives, like strings or numbers, are not allowed.
Memory Management:<br>

Unlike Map, the entries in a WeakMap do not prevent the garbage collection of keys. If the only reference to a key is within the WeakMap, both the key and its associated value can be garbage collected.
Iteration:<br>

WeakMap does not have methods for directly iterating over its keys or values. Iteration is not supported due to the potential lack of references to keys.
Use Cases:<br>

WeakMap is useful when you want to associate additional data with an object without preventing that object from being garbage collected.

        <p>
            Set:<br>
            Values:<br>
            
            A Set is a collection of unique values, and it can store any data type, including primitive values and objects.
            Memory Management:<br>
            
            The values stored in a Set are not tied to the set itself. If a value is stored in a set and becomes unreachable, it won't prevent the garbage collection of that value.
            Iteration:<br>
            
            You can easily iterate over the elements of a Set, and it maintains the order of insertion.<br>
