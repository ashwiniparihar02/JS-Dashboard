    <h1>THIS</h1>
    <p>
        In JavaScript, the this keyword is a special identifier that refers to the current object, which depends on how a function is called or how an object is accessed. The behavior of this is determined by the context in which it is used. Here are some common use cases:<br>
        <b>Inside a Method:</b> When this is used inside a method of an object, it refers to the object .<br><br>

        <b>Constructor Functions:</b> When used within a constructor function, this refers to the instance of the object being created. <br><br>

        <b>Arrow Functions:</b> Arrow functions do not have their own this. They lexically bind this to the enclosing context's this.<br><br>
